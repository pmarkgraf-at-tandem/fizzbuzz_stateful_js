## Participants

Time limit per writer/talker?
* (MR) I like the idea of having a 2 person pair per test case, and they can reach out for group assistance if necessary
* (JD) Break up pairs by concept (ie a test case), not by time boundary
* (WD) Intervals by concept is a good idea

Test case brainstorm per requirement?
* (MR) I'm for writing out all of these as a group together at the start with one scribe
* (WD) Would also be happy with a verbal discussion

Write a given/when/then per test?
* (MR) I'm for this

Shared Goals:
1. Write a test case
    a. If it's failing fix it
2. If all tests are passing, write a new test case
3. Let people struggle with an test case, if they need help from group let them ask for it.
    3a. If progress is stalled for a significant time, intervene
4.
